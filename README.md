a killer procedural program for video editing.  
well.. you just have to try it!!! 

gscript - control structures conditionals, etc. 
----------------------------------------
basic things you expect from a language are not inherintly available, but can be used via this plugin :

The Steve Moore video below has examples of Gscript within avisynth.

you will trip out on entering a few commands targeting source video files and watch it do it's thing!
Things that take hours and days in After Effects can be done in a few minutes.
support for installed fonts on your system, blendmodes, audio amplitude detection ( can be used for beat detection )
audio frequency detection , etc. , etc

if you do use avisynth, please get in touch with me, I have been meaning to get back into it.

The Videos
---------------------
A series of remix videos I did for Voltaire Records in 2012 using Avisynth:

Steve Moore Video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeJtHxsS1OM

used basic beat detection by supplying two audio tracks, but only outputting one

one audio track is rendered, the other is the beat sync just used for the program
